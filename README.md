# Fingerprint-Matching-with-Python
A fingerprint matching project with python using a dataset provided by kaggle under  the name 'Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset (SOCOFing)', feel free to play around with the code the way you want, you can add some lines of code or even remove some. 
I also implemented a small voice assistant feature just to add some spice to the project.
# PACKAGES USED
-OS : you don't have to install it
-cv2 (computer vision) : pip install computer-vision 
-playsound : pip install playsound
-google text to speech : pip install gTTS

# ADDITIONAL INFO
For the speak function, I created a function called name_generator() to be able to save multiple audio files and use the speak() function repeatedly.
I am no expert at python, so when executing the program you may encounter some problems at first, if you got to know the reason behind that feel free to modify it and contact me.
# THANK YOU
